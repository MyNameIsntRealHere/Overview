      <h1>Delivery Drivers</h1>
      <p>Delivery drivers are used to automate the process of delivering supplies from the loading bay to the store. You can hire delivery drivers via the <a href="vehicles.html">workers tab</a>. Each delivery driver you hire requires their own <a href="vehicles.html">vehicle</a>. The statistics of that vehicle decide how fast and how big the deliveries will be along with the level of your delivery driver. They level up by doing their job.</p>
